# How-to Guides

How-to guides provide goal-oriented instructions for users who already
understand the basics of the Jenkins Tekton Client Plugin.

They focus on solving specific problems rather than teaching concepts
from scratch.

## Scope

How-to guides should:
- Assume some prior knowledge
- Be concise and task-focused
- Help users achieve a clear outcome
