# Documentation

This directory organizes the Jenkins Tekton Client Plugin documentation
using the Divio documentation model.

## Why Divio

The Divio documentation model separates documentation by purpose:
learning, problem-solving, reference, and explanation.
This helps readers find the right type of information more easily and
keeps documentation coherent as it grows.

## Structure

- Tutorials: Learning-oriented guides for new users
- How-to Guides: Problem-solving instructions
- Reference: Technical reference material
- Explanation: Conceptual and architectural documentation

Existing documentation files remain unchanged and are mapped conceptually
to this structure.
